	leOS.h - <l>ittle <e>mbedded <O>perating <S>ystem 
	This is not a complete OS nor an RTOS as you usually know but
	it's a simple scheduler to schedule little works in background, so that 
	you	can forget about them. It's designed for Arduino and other common
	Atmel microcontroller (for the complete list refer to the README file).

	Written by Leonardo Miliani <leonardo AT leonardomiliani DOT com>
	
	History:
    v. 0.1.2:  fixed a bug in the management of one-time pads
    v. 0.1.1:  now the user can choose between 32-bit & 64-bit math
    v. 0.1.0:  leOS now works correcty on Arduino Leonardo/Atmega32U4
    v. 0.0.8:  now the user can modify running tasks    
    v. 0.0.7:  introduced one-time tasks
	v. 0.0.6:  support for Arduino Leonardo/Atmega32U4
    v. 0.0.5:  fixed some bugs and optimized code & memory consumption
	v. 0.0.4:  use of a 64-bit counter so the scheduler will overflow after 584942417 years
    v. 0.0.3:  added methods to pause and restart a task
	v. 0.0.2:  user can now delete scheduled tasks
	v. 0.0.1:  early release - user can only add tasks
